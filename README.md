# PythonFundamentals

# Python is an interpreted language
- It is compiled everytime that it runs
    - Advatages
        - Easier to Debug
        - Fails imediately when run
    compiled laguages may compile but not run
        - Very portable all you need is the interpreter to run python
    - Disadvantage
        - Slower. Inefficient to compile code everytime you run it

# Two Ways to Execute Python
 1. Real Time Interpreter
 2. create *.py file and run in the terminal
